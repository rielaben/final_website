            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>In 2016, Rohit Mogalayapalli founded the Michigan Sports Analytics Society as a 
                University of Michigan sophomore. The club started with analyzing professional 
                sports datasets from sites like Basketball Reference as well as conducting 
                analytics work for University of Michigan varsity sports teams.

            <h2>Baltimore Ravens Free Agency Competition</h2>
            <p>In 2017, we partnered with the Baltimore Ravens to hold a contest where students 
                were tasked with building an analytical model to accurately predict the
                 salaries of the 2018 NFL Free Agent Class.

            <h2>2017 MSAS Hackathon</h2>
            <p>In 2017, we hosted our first hackathon! The MSAS Hackathon was an event 
                designed to increase knowledge of both our group and the field of sports 
                analytics at the University of Michigan. The event drew a wide range of 
                students and faculty, and gave participants the opportunity to get hands-on
                 practice in the field of analytics.

            <h2>2018 Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium</h2>
            <p>In 2018 we created The Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium. This event was 
                designed to showcase the field of sports analytics at the University of 
                Michigan and beyond, as well as cultivate interest in the future of the field. 
                The Symposium included presentations from both students and faculty, who 
                shared various projects and findings from the field of sports analytics with 
                the audience. The Symposium was a huge success, and it laid the groundwork 
                for MSAS symposiums in the future.

            <h2>2019</h2>
            <p>In 2019, we had a fantastic year, running successful 2019 Hackathon and 2019 
                Symposium events. Our attendance grew, and our founder, Rohit, accepted a 
                position to work for the Baltimore Ravens as a Performance Analytics Intern!

            <h2>2020</h2>
            <p>2020, like for many organizations, was a tough year. We unfortunately had to
                 cancel the 2020 Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium due to covid, and after
                  a great school year of progress the club operations came to a screeching 
                  halt in March with the lockdowns. After months of preparation from the 
                  leadership team, the club underwent a successful transition to our new,
                   virtual, format for the 2020-2021 school year. Even with the virtual 
                   format we had a ton of fun running meetings and learning more about 
                   sports analytics!

            <h2>2021</h2>
            <p>2021 brings new opportunities for the organization. In April, we will be hosting
                 the first ever virtual Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium!
